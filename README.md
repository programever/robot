# Demo Robot

This project is bootstrapped with [Create Elm App](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app).

You can start Elm server by using `elm-app start`

Topic:
Create a Javascript application in which you can simulate controlling a robot. The robot should be placed on a 5x5 grid. Supply controls that let you move the robot forwards in the direction it is facing, and rotate the robot in place to face any cardinal direction. Use any Javascript framework you’re comfortable with, as long as it runs in modern web browsers (we’re not looking for backwards compatibility in this test).
